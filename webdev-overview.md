# **BACKEND**

## Languages, Frameworks and Databases

**Languages:** Node.js, PHP, Python, .NET, Java

**Node frameworks:**

- **Express**: webserver, routing, SSR (server-side rendering)
- **PUG**: view templates for Express

**Databases:** MongoDB, Postgress, MySQL

## Options to develop and deploy backends:

1.  Write everything and manage server, Infra as a Service (IaaS):

    - [Linode](https://www.linode.com)
    - [Serverdo.in](]https://serverdo.in/)

2.  Write my backend and use Cloud provider or Platform as a Service (PaaS):

    - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - free forever for limited resources
    - Azure
    - AWS
    - Google Cloud Platform

3.  Use a Backend as a Service (BaaS)  
    BaaS providers offer a number of server-side capabilities. For instance:

    - Database management
    - Cloud storage (for user-generated content)
    - User authentication
    - Push notifications
    - Remote updating
    - Hosting
    - Other platform- or vendor-specific functionalities; for instance, Firebase offers Google - search indexing

    I used Parse in the past, not so simple, can be discontinued.

    ### OPTIONS:

    - Firebase

# **FRONTEND**

## Frontend languages:

- HTML, CSS, JS (works together)

## Frontend frameworks:

- Bootstrap: CSS library, very popular for styling (by Twitter)
- Jquery
- Vue: View framework, looks like very good and simple.
- React: People like it, better than vue? (by Facebook)
- Angular 9: Complete and complex framework (by Google)
- AnguarJS: Old, not worth starting a project on it (by Google)
